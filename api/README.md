## Why NestJS

I never tried NestJS, but I've wanted to learn it for the longest time. Since the job application mentioned NestJS, I figured this was the perfect time to learn it. Normally I'd make this with a simple Express backend, but I decided to take this as a learning opportunity to learn a new framework. And who would want to skip out on an opportunity to learn something new?

## How to run
