# VodafoneZiggo case for quotes app

## How to run

Make sure you have [bun](https://bun.sh) installed, as I use this as node environment. Then follow the instructions in both `/app` and `/api` readme's

## How would I improve this if I had more time

If it'd be a bigger project, I'd make a couple of adjustments.

1. I'd add `swagger` to the backend to create OpenAPI documentation. Then using `orval`, I'd generate the React hooks. Significant overkill for now, but it'd be nice to auto generate.
